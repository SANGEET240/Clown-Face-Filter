# 🤡 Real-Time Clown Face Filter
Turn any boring face into a circus-level masterpiece — in real-time!
This project uses OpenCV + Mediapipe Face Mesh to track your facial landmarks and slap on a clown nose, funny lips, and cartoonish makeup 🎨.

## 🎪 Features
🟥 Clown Nose – Big red circle right on target (no honking sound yet, sorry).  
👄 Clown Lips – Perfectly over-exaggerated lipstick… way better than real life.  
👀 Crazy Eyes – Adds silly shapes around your eyes to give you that “just joined the circus” look.  
⚡ Real-time filter – Works live with your webcam.  
🤖 Powered by Python + Mediapipe + OpenCV.
